# SQLite Foreign Data Wrapper for PostgreSQL
This PostgreSQL extension is a Foreign Data Wrapper for [SQLite][1].

The current version can work with PostgreSQL 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14.

## Installation
### 1. Install SQLite library

For debian or ubuntu:
<pre>
apt-get install libsqlite3-dev
</pre>

You can also [download SQLite source code][2] and [build SQLite][3].

### 2. Build and install sqlite_fdw

Add a directory of pg_config to PATH and build and install sqlite_fdw.
<pre>
make USE_PGXS=1
make install USE_PGXS=1
</pre>

If you want to build sqlite_fdw in a source tree of PostgreSQL, use
<pre>
make
make install
</pre>

## Usage
### Load extension
<pre>
CREATE EXTENSION sqlite_fdw;
</pre>

### Create server
Please specify SQLite database path using `database` option:
<pre>
CREATE SERVER sqlite_server FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER sqlite_fdw OPTIONS (database '/tmp/test.db');
</pre>


### Create foreign table
Please specify `table` option if SQLite table name is different from foreign table name.
<pre>
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE t1(a integer, b text) SERVER sqlite_server OPTIONS (table 't1_sqlite');
</pre>

If you want to update tables, please add `OPTIONS (key 'true')` to a primary key or unique key like the following:
<pre>
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE t1(a integer OPTIONS (key 'true'), b text) SERVER sqlite_server OPTIONS (table 't1_sqlite');
</pre>

If you need to convert INT SQLite column (epoch Unix Time) to be treated/visualized as TIMESTAMP in PostgreSQL, please add `OPTIONS (column_type 'INT')` when
defining FOREIGN table at PostgreSQL like the following:
<pre>
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE t1(a integer, b text, c timestamp without time zone OPTIONS (column_type 'INT')) SERVER sqlite_server OPTIONS (table 't1_sqlite');
</pre>
### Import foreign schema
<pre>
IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA public FROM SERVER sqlite_server INTO public;
</pre>

### Access foreign table
<pre>
SELECT * FROM t1;
</pre>

## Features
- Support update to foreign table  
- WHERE clauses are pushdowned  
- Aggregate function are pushdowned
- Order By is pushdowned
- Joins (left/right/inner) are pushdowned
- Limit and Offset are pushdowned (*when all tables queried are fdw)
- Transactions  
- Support TRUNCATE by deparsing into DELETE statement without WHERE clause  
- Allow control over whether foreign servers keep connections open after transaction completion. This is controlled by `keep_connections` and defaults to on  
- Support list cached connections to foreign servers by using function sqlite_fdw_get_connections()  
- Support discard cached connections to foreign servers by using function sqlite_fdw_disconnect(), sqlite_fdw_disconnect_all().  
- Support Bulk Insert by using batch_size option  
- Support Insert/Update with generated column  

## Limitations
- `COPY` command for foreign tables is not supported
- IMPORT of generated column is not supported
- Insert into a partitioned table which has foreign partitions is not supported
- TRUNCATE in sqlite_fdw always delete data of both parent and child tables (no matter user inputs `TRUNCATE table CASCADE` or `TRUNCATE table RESTRICT`) if there are foreign-keys references with "ON DELETE CASCADE" clause.
